WordPress template for the Pirate Party Netherlands
======
This wordpress template is made by the Pirate Party Netherlands. It is based on the template used by the Pirate Party Australia https://pirateparty.org.au/. 

But this template is a modification in such a way that it is multi domain compatible. And therefore this template is more flexible and customizable then the original. The following options can be changed per department / domain.

### Customization options
* Custom logo
* Custom website
* Custom menu
* Custom social media links
* Custom banners on the front page. Or none
* Custom headlines on the right column
* Custom twitter accounts

With this setup, it is easier to maintain all the different department websites in one organization. All websites will have there own content, but the look and feel is always consistent throughout the hole organization. This makes it also a more uniform look.

This template does also support multi screen resolutions and will work on a mobile device.
